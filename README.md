For english translation see below. It will be posted eventually.

#About the project:
This projects creates a system for updating and tracking changes in the free beds of hospitals and their departments. It allows the hospital administration to easily make changes to their current resources and gives any user (potential client of the hospital) a quick and easy way to determine which hospital has avaliale beds and how many.
This project was made because of the increasing number of people in Bulgaria who have to cycle between 4 or more hospitals before getting accepted or dying. Even the emergency responders have no way of knowing which hospital has avaliable beds.

##Possible clients:
This project is targeted towards countries, provinces or states with no present system that would quickly relay this kind of information to both the general public and emergency responders.
